\description{
Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit (GOF) Test.
}
\usage{
hoslem.test(x, y, g = 10)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a numeric vector of observations, binary (0/1).
}
  \item{y}{
expected values.
}
  \item{g}{
number of bins to use to calculate quantiles.
Needs to be at least 2. The degrees of freedom of the test is \code{g-2}
but the number of bins might also depend on the data (i.e. due to identical
quantile values that lead to empty bins). In case when the number of bins 
does not equal \code{g}, the degrees of freedom will depend on the
number of bins that is less than \code{g}. In such case a warning is produced.
}
}
\details{
The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is a statistical test for goodness of fit for 
logistic regression models.
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components: 
  \item{statistic}{the value of the chi-squared test statistic,
    (\code{sum((observed - expected)^2 / expected)}).}
  \item{parameter}{the degrees of freedom of the approximate 
    chi-squared distribution of the test statistic (\code{g - 2}).}
  \item{p.value}{the p-value for the test.}
  \item{method}{a character string indicating the type of test performed.}
  \item{data.name}{a character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
  \item{observed}{the observed frequencies in a \code{g}-by-2 
    contingency table.}
  \item{expected}{the expected frequencies in a \code{g}-by-2 
    contingency table.}
